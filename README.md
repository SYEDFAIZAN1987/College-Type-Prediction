![College Type Prediction](https://github.com/SYEDFAIZAN1987/College-Type-Prediction/blob/main/pic%20main.jpg)

## 📘 About the Project

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify colleges into **Public** or **Private** categories based on the College dataset from the **ISLR** package. The dataset provides information about U.S. colleges, including tuition fees, student demographics, and graduation rates.

By employing advanced modeling techniques, this project showcases the ability to predict college types accurately, identify significant predictors, and explore the educational sector in depth.

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Comprehensive data cleaning, including handling of outliers and feature encoding.
   - Correlation analysis to identify meaningful predictors.

2. **Logistic Regression Modeling**:
   - Multiple iterations of logistic regression models.
   - Feature selection using Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Confusion matrices, ROC curves, and AUC values for model evaluation.

4. **Business Impact**:
   - Insights into predictors like **Out-of-State Tuition**, **Alumni Donation Percentage**, and **Enrollment** that distinguish public from private institutions.

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Best Predictors**:
  - **Out-of-State Tuition**: Higher tuition is strongly associated with private institutions.
  - **Percentage of Alumni Donating**: Higher alumni donation rates correlate with private institutions.
  - **Enrollment**: Larger enrollment numbers favor private classification.

- **Model Accuracy**:
  - Training Data: 93.93% accuracy, AUC = 0.9746.
  - Testing Data: 93.53% accuracy, AUC = 0.9747.

- **Confusion Matrix**:
  - Balanced high sensitivity (85.71%) and specificity (96.15%) in the test dataset.
